# 📌 EDA:Insurance Claims Data 

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and risk assessment** in insurance claims data. The goal is to clean, analyze, and extract insights to access the risk and detect fraudulent claims and improve decision-making.

## 📊 Key Tasks & Insights
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Merged multiple datasets, handled missing values, and corrected data types.
- **Fraud Detection:** Identified unreported injury claims and flagged potential fraud cases.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Used hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA) to detect anomalies in claim patterns.
- **Risk Assessment:** Analyzed claim trends by demographics, region, and claim type to highlight high-risk segments.
- **Visualizations & Reporting:** Created pie charts, bar plots, and time-series analysis to showcase fraud trends and insights.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
- **Tools:** VS Code
